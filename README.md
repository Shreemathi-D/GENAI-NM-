# Youtube Video Summarization with Transformers
# Overview
The  Youtube Video Summarization project aims to extract YouTube video transcripts and generate concise summaries, catering to educators, researchers, and individuals seeking a quick overview of video content without watching it entirely.This project delves into a Python code that fetches transcripts from YouTube videos and then summarizes them using state-of-the-art machine learning models.
# Key Features
* Item 1 Utilizes the YouTubeTranscriptApi to retrieve the transcript of the specified YouTube video.
* Item 2 Processes the retrieved transcript by concatenating its segments together into a single text.
* Item 3 Initializes a summarization pipeline from the Transformers library, setting up the environment for text summarization.
* Item 4 Segments the transcript into chunks suitable for summarization, ensuring manageable processing.
* Item 5 Generates summaries for each chunk of text using the initialized summarization pipeline.
# Steps to use the summary generator
1. Download the Ipython Notebook File (.ipynb) from the repository.
2. Open it in Jupyter Notebook or in Google Colab
3. Give the desired YouTube video link in the declaration and get the Video summary.
